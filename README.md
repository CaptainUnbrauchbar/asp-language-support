# Answer Set Programming Language Support (for Clingo)

 | [Potassco](https://potassco.org/) | [Potassco on Github](https://github.com/potassco) | [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) | 

## Features

This Extension uses Clingo Answer Set Solver (bundled), developed by Potassco (University of Potsdam).
We added multi-file support with v0.4.0!

If you have any suggestions for a new feature or anything else please E-Mail me: frankreiter@uni-potsdam.de

## Usage

Just right click anywhere on a logic program (.lp) file and select `> Compute all Answer Sets` or `> Compute the first Answer Set`.
A new Terminal will open with the results!

If you want to add **additional startup arguments** you can use the `> Compute Answer Sets (config.json)` option.

First generate a **sample config.json** file with the `ASPLanguage: Initialize clingo config file in current working directory` command *(Press Ctrl+Shift+P)*. 

This will create a config file with all supported arguments/settings in your current working directory. 
If you want to use your **own config file**, just change the config file name in the extension settings.
Additionally you can use **arguments not directly supported** by the config.json by passing them in the **"customArgs" setting** as a String.

You can also specify **additional files** to interpret in this config using the relative path from the current working directory.

See the Clingo [Documentation](https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases/download/v2.2.0/guide.pdf) for more details on the config settings!

If you want to use your own Version of Clingo from PATH with this extension, please enable **"Use PATH Clingo"** option in settings!
